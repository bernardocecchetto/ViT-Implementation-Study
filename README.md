# ViT-Implementation-Study
The following repository contains all the implementation and explanation, step by step, of a transformer.


You can find the explanation inside [a relative link]notebooks/vit.ipynb. And, to run the training and evaluation of the MNIST dataset, using transformers, you can run [a relative link]app.py using the [a relative link]environment.yml requirements to the virtual environment.
