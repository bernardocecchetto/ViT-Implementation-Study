# ViT-Implementation-Study
The following repository contains all the implementation and explanation, step by step, of a transformer from the paper "Attention is all you need" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)


You can find the explanation inside [notebooks/vit.ipynb](notebooks/vit.ipynb). And, to run the training and evaluation of the MNIST dataset, using transformers, you can run [app.py](app.py) using the [environment.yml](environment.yml) requirements to the virtual environment.
